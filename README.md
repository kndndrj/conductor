# Conductor

A single-file shell script to manage multiple docker-compose manifests.

## Usage

- Clone the repo (or download the script)
- Run `./conductor --help`
- Optionally, move the script to a directory in your `$PATH`
- Enjoy

NOTE: I tried to make this script as POSIX-compliant as possible, but I only tested it on macos.
